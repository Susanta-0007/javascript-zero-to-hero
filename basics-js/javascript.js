/*
!Javascript :
JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, interpreted,  loosely typed, asynchronous  programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it .

* Lightweight :
  easy to implementation , quick executions , Asynchronous Capabilities .

* Cross-platform : 
  js can run various platform including desktop, web, mobiles etc .

* Single-threaded :
  js can run a piece of code at a time , use a single core to execution of a code .
  JavaScript processes tasks sequentially, one after another, on a single core .

* Interpreted  :
  js primary an interpreted language , the code executed by line by line at runtime . 
  But now modern js engines , like Google v8 : use Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation to convert the js code to faster
  machine code during execution .

* Loosely typed :
  it does not attaches its variables to any specific data type .

* Asynchronous :
  asynchronous programming technique allows your code to handle operations that take time to complate , without 
  blocking execution of rest of the code . (fetching data)
